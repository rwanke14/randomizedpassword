# randomizedpassword
password generator.

The HTML launches a password generator that generates a random password based on what the user selects throughout the prompts. The user can select from lower case, upper case, numbers, and special characters after choosing a password length between 6-128 characters. 

At the end the password is passed back into the text box on the webpage.

To make the password generator look a bit nicer, I've add CSS to include a background and updated typography from the bootstrap jumbotron settings.
